# FOS Proposals
## Express your love for Open Source!

This repository serves as an archive of *F*ree and *O*pen *S*ource proposals.
Since [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1) is the only such 
program where I participated myself, the dump is organized as such.
If you have proposals from GSoC/KDE-Soc/any, feel free to send a PR.


## Adding your proposal?

All proposals need to be in Github flavored markdown format.
If you have a Google Doc, conversion should be pretty straightforward
using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)

```
pandoc -r  docx infile.docx -w markdown -o outfile.md  --extract-media=unique-name

```

Alternatively, you can leverage on [gdocs2md](https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md)
which in my experience so far gives superior output to `pandoc`.
Suggestions are always welcome.
